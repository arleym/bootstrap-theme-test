# bootstrap-theme-test

A simple theme UI tester for Bootstrap. Two pages in this repo; one with default Bootstrap colors, the other where you can use `link` to test your new theme variables. Patternlab.io is pretty cool too, but I wanted something flatter and simpler.


## Installation
- No dependencies, just open index.html
- Consider changing `css/style.css` - like perhaps changing the background color on `.example` if this will better reflect what you will be building.
- The file compare.html uses iframes to visually compare the two styles


## Todo
- compare.html 
- JS file
- Add index, test, compare to the main nav
- Scrollspy with responsive https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/scrollspy/
- audio, video
- DSP patterns, list card SRP
- browser / device test
- schema / a11y test
- screen reader test
- Ask DD about our JS form validation?
